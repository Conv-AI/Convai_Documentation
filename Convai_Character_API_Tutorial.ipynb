This helps maintain context of conversation and extract relevant information from the chat-history belonging to the session. \n",

To continue an old conversation session, we pass the sessionID from that conversation. The system returns back a value for the sessionID, based on therequirement. If we are indicating the start of a new session, it returns a new **sessionID** otherwise it returns the old same value as passed in the request. Simple as that.\n",
